# WalletKeepApp
Native Java Android App for keeping tabs on your Wallets. Users are able to add api keys from exchanges (i.e.: Binance) and the app fetches the balances for all cryptocurrencies. Manual additions are also supported. The app uses architecture components such as Room, Viewmodels and LiveData. Additionally, it adheres to the [RVVM pattern](https://android.jlelse.eu/android-architecture-components-now-with-100-more-mvvm-11629a630125). A screenshot can be seen below.
